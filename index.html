          <p>
            In this project, I was asked to create a page about my favourite
            type of food. During this week I learned a lot about transforming
            images into various sizes. It was an interesting workshop and I was
            able to create a basic page about pasta which is my favourite food.
            I implemented all new skills learned in the workshop including how
            to use both the transform and grid elements. The use of java-script
            was also implemented in this project to switch the theme of the web
            page.

          <strong>Weather App</strong>
          <br />
          <p>
            In this project, I was asked to build a weather app. This was a
            challenging project but I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it.
            During this 8-week workshop, I learned a lot about CSS, HTML &
            Java-script. I also learned about API integrations, bootstrap
            framework & various external libraries used in the world of coding.
            <br />
            At the end of this workshop, I was able to create a functional
            weather app which gives the users current location, temperature,
            date, humidity & wind-speed. This app also has a search input where
            the user can search for any city across the world.

            <strong>World Clock</strong>
            <br />
            <p>
              For my world clock project, I was asked to create an app showing
              the current time across various cities around the world. During
              this 2-week workshop, I learned about HTML inputs and was taught
              to use moment.tz() to pull out the current time in different
              timezones.
              <br />
              This workshop was great and I was able to create a clock app which
              displays the current time for a list of various cities. This time
              is also being updated every second which I find very cool. The
              user is also able to select a city from the drop-down menu at the
              top of the app to find out the current time in those timezones.
              The user is also able to find out their current time by clicking
              on the location icon next to the select menu. This was built using
              moment.tz.guess()
