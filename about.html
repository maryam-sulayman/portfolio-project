        <p class="first-paragraph">
          I am a biomedical scientist who has a new-found passion for coding!
          <br />

          I began my coding journey back in 2022 with the hopes of learning a
          new skill. I was amazed with how quickly I fell in love with learning
          how to code.
          <br />
          <br />
          I work part-time as a brand ambassador & healthcare assistant and I
          thrive well in fast-paced environments while meeting schedules using
          excellent planning and coordination skills.
        </p>
        <p class="second-paragraph">
          In my free time, I love to cook, listen to music and participate in
          sports. I represented my state in arts, volleyball & badminton
          competitions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Being team leader in these competitions taught me to work
          collaboratively.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I get the chance, I take part in giving back to my community by
          donating necessities to orphanages and organising charity events at
          local mosques.
